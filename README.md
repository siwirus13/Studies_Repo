# Studies_Repo

This repository consists of my projects, scripts and code snippets related to my academic studies.
It is not a complete library of my codes as I don't have a good habit of pushing everything, but everything from my uni tasks should be here. 

Files in each folder are familiar to other files due to the nature of uni lessons to which they are related.
