# Studies_Repo

This repository consists of my projects, scripts and code snippets related to my academicstudies.
It is not a complete library of my codes as I don't have a good habit of pushing everything, but everything rather recent should be here or should get here soon. 


Projects here are written in:

- Python
- C / C++
- SQL

And cover different topics like:

- Data Science
- Machine Learning
- Control Systems
- Sorting Algoriths
- and more!
